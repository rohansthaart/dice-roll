Roll The Dice App
This is a simple React Native application that simulates the roll of two dice. The app uses the react-native-haptic-feedback library to provide haptic feedback when the dice are rolled.

Features

How to Use
To roll the dice, simply press the "Roll The Dice" button. The dice images will change to reflect the result of the roll, and the result will be displayed above the dice.

Components
